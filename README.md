TP3 Deliverables:

15112 Backrooms, By Henry Kim

This game is a reference to the mysterious ‘BackRooms’, where the goal is to stay alive from a monster in an unending maze. Obviously, as it is not possible within my abilities to create a pixelated animation of the monster, the “monster” is going to be a picture that seems to chase you. As the picture gets closer to you, the horror music will be turned louder and louder, until the screen turns black when it catches you.

The objective of this game is simple. Referencing from “Slender Man”, there will be 8 total pictures you will have to find before the game ends. These pictures will be randomly distributed, in a map using an algorithm, and the map itself will be randomly created under an algorithm that ensures that there is enough movespace for the character.

Run Instructions:

Nothing. Just download CMU Graphics with the same code environment, and run the python code.

ShortCut Commmands:

M - Mute
